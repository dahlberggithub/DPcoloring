# DPcoloring

This project contains code in SAGEMATH to calculate the DP function for graphs. DP coloring is a generalization of list coloring. For a full intoduction see the paper [A Polynomial Method for Counting Colorings of S-labeled Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11744) for the particular approach we are using to calculate the DP function.
